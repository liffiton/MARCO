OVERVIEW
--------

MiniCARD is a *cardinality solver* based on MiniSAT [www.minisat.se].  MiniCARD
handles cardinality constraints natively, using the same efficient data
structures and techniques MiniSAT uses for clauses, giving it much better
performance on cardinality constraints than CNF encodings of those constraints
passed to a typical SAT solver.  It can read the standard DIMACS CNF format,
the OPB pseudo-boolean format (with linear cardinality constraints only), and
CNF+, a format that extends CNF to include cardinality constraints.  

The CNF+ format extends the DIMACS CNF format, adding the ability to specify
cardinality constraints alongside regular clauses like so:

  c Example: Two cardinality constraints followed by a clause
  p cnf+ 7 3
  1 -2 3 5 -7 <= 3
  4 5 6 -7 >= 2
  3 5 7 0

See the tests/in/ directory for example files.

Run minicard with the --help and --help-verb flags for details on command line
options.


HISTORY
-------

Version 1.1 added a basic ability to parse and solve OPB-format instances
(http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB12/format.pdf) in which the constraints are
limited to linear cardinality constraints only (i.e., all weights are -1 or
+1).  To solve OPB instances, use the -opb command line flag.
