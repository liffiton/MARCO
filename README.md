MARCO: an efficient MUS and MSS/MCS enumeration tool
====================================================

This is a Python implementation of the MARCO/MARCOs algorithm [1,2] for
enumerating MUSes and MSS/MCSes of infeasible constraint systems (currently:
CNF, GCNF, and SMT).  This implementation makes use of MUSer2 [3,4] for MUS
extraction and MiniSAT 2.2 [5] for satisfiability testing and the generation of
SAT models.

## Setup

This implementation makes use of Python bindings for MiniSAT that must be built
before running MARCO.

Tested Platforms:

 - Linux
 - Cygwin
 - OS X

Requirements:

 - Python 2.7 or above (compatible with Python 3)
 - A standard build environment (make, gcc or clang, etc.)

To build and test the Python bindings:

    $ cd pyminisolvers
    $ make
    $ python test_minisolvers.py

Additionally, the following are recommended, depending on your needs:

 - Z3 Python interface for analyzing SMT instances.

     Available as part of the Z3 distribution: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

 - A MUSer2 binary for analyzing CNF/GCNF.  The included `muser2-para` binary
   is compiled for x86-64 Linux.  For other platforms, download and compile
   from the source (license: GPL).

     Available from: https://bitbucket.org/anton_belov/muser2-para

   Without a working MUSer2 binary, you can still run MARCO on CNF/GCNF in a
   fall-back mode that uses a basic, *much less efficient* deletion-based MUS
   extractor using Minisat directly (see the `--force-minisat` option).


## Usage

Example: `./marco.py tests/test1.cnf`

Run `./marco.py --help` for a list of available options.

Input files may be in CNF, GCNF (group oriented CNF), or SMT2 format.  Input
files may be gzipped.

The supported GCNF format is specified in:
  http://www.satcompetition.org/2011/rules.pdf

The output lists MUSes ("U") and MSSes ("S"), one per line.  In 'verbose' mode
(-v), each line also lists the indexes of the constraints included in each set
(with 1-based counting).  MCSes are the complements of the MSSes w.r.t. the
original set of input constraints (e.g., if MARCO reports an MSS "1 3 4" for a
5-constraint input, the corresponding MCS is constraints 2 and 5).  If you want
the MCSes printed directly, use the '--print-mcses' command line option; MCSes
will be printed on lines starting with "C" (in place of the "S" lines for their
MSSes).
